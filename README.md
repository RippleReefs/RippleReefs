Welcome to a world of pixelated reefs, full of corals, crustaceans, jellyfish, whales, dolphins, sharks, and more!

We are an xNFT project which will enable the holders of our xNFTs to interact with, learn, and collect all types
of marine-life in the form of an xNFT. We plan to release our collection with a portion of the royalties going 
towards conservations which we will collaborate with. Initially, we want to release traditional "static" xNFTs 
with pixelated artwork of marine-life for our community to collect and trade.

We have two end goals which will make our xNFTs entirely unique to any other project out there:

1.) Dynamically updating our xNFTs' metadata by pulling from Geo-Tagged marine-life from around the globe:

    - Launch xNFTs tied to real-world marine-life that have been geo-tagged so that the holder of that xNFT is
    able to track their specific marine-life featured in their xNFTs, see migration habits, and other interesting information.
    
2.) Live-feed/Daily updated coral reef monitoring xNFTs.

    - Launch xNFTs tied to live-feed monitoring cameras to provide a "window into the ocean".
    Holders can observe, (in real-time), coral reefs from around the globe so that holders of those
    xNFTs get a more personal experience when they look at their ever-changing xNFT.
    - We plan on accomplishing this by sending bits of video data through the blockchain and update the
    meta-data of our xNFTs daily, if not second by second. We will aim for the equivalent of HD video.

to do our part in the conservation of our beautiful oceans and the life that they hold.
